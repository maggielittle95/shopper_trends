- In the interview you are asked to do an exploratory analysis covering 3 areas of interest for the clothing brand (Customer Segmentation, Product Insights and Marketing Campaign ROI)and present your findings visually to the sales and marketing team. Your analysis will be used to drive a campaign strategy for Q4 - the busiest time of year for e-commerce! 

Primary Files:
- This project uses SQL and Python using Jupyter notebooks.
- This project uses 2 datasets: shopping_trends.csv and marketing_trends.csv . 
- You will be required to combine these files using a merge function via Python or a JOIN statement via SQL on these files to cross examine consumer behavior.

Data Analysis:
- Requirements:
- 1. Read in shopping_trends.csv and mock_data.csv files.
- 2. Use pandas to create a dataframe by merging shopping_trends.csv and marketing_trends.csv
- 3. Clean column names and make sure empty cells have null values
- 4. (Optional: only pull relevant column names to perform your exploratory analysis)

Enriching the Data:
- 1. Since this interview is based on example questions, you may be required to fill in data where not provided. For example, most marketing teams would like to know their average order value and the customer lifetime value of their company. However, these are not columns already provided. You can create a dataframe or alter your table based on new values to supplement this exercise. Always great to show how you can innovate in an interview!
